# Test Plan for COBOL Application

This test plan outlines the business logic and scenarios that need to be validated with the business stakeholders. Once validated, you can use this plan to create unit tests and integration tests for the Node.js application.

## 1. View Balance

### Test Case 1.1: View Current Balance

**Description:** Verify that the current balance is displayed correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Start the application.
2. Select option 1 to view the balance.

**Expected Result:** The application should display the current balance.

## 2. Credit Account

### Test Case 2.1: Credit Account with Valid Amount

**Description:** Verify that the account is credited with a valid amount.

**Steps:**
1. Start the application.
2. Select option 2 to credit the account.
3. Enter a valid credit amount (e.g., 100.00).

**Expected Result:** The application should display the new balance after adding the credit amount.

### Test Case 2.2: Credit Account with Zero Amount

**Description:** Verify that the account balance remains unchanged when credited with zero amount.

**Steps:**
1. Start the application.
2. Select option 2 to credit the account.
3. Enter 0.00 as the credit amount.

**Expected Result:** The application should display the same balance as before.

## 3. Debit Account

### Test Case 3.1: Debit Account with Valid Amount

**Description:** Verify that the account is debited with a valid amount.

**Steps:**
1. Start the application.
2. Select option 3 to debit the account.
3. Enter a valid debit amount that is less than or equal to the current balance (e.g., 50.00).

**Expected Result:** The application should display the new balance after subtracting the debit amount.

### Test Case 3.2: Debit Account with Amount Greater Than Balance

**Description:** Verify that the application prevents debiting an amount greater than the current balance.

**Steps:**
1. Start the application.
2. Select option 3 to debit the account.
3. Enter a debit amount that is greater than the current balance (e.g., 2000.00).

**Expected Result:** The application should display an "Insufficient funds" message and the balance should remain unchanged.

### Test Case 3.3: Debit Account with Zero Amount

**Description:** Verify that the account balance remains unchanged when debited with zero amount.

**Steps:**
1. Start the application.
2. Select option 3 to debit the account.
3. Enter 0.00 as the debit amount.

**Expected Result:** The application should display the same balance as before.

## 4. Exit Application

### Test Case 4.1: Exit the Application

**Description:** Verify that the application exits correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Start the application.
2. Select option 4 to exit the application.

**Expected Result:** The application should display an exit message and terminate.

## Summary

This test plan covers the main functionalities of the COBOL application, including viewing the balance, crediting the account, debiting the account, and exiting the application. Validate this test plan with the business stakeholders to ensure it meets the business requirements. Once validated, you can use this plan to create corresponding unit tests and integration tests for the Node.js application.
